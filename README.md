# AnisotropicFlowMPD

Investigations of the quark-gluon matter (QGM) properties at high net-baryon densities is the main scientific mission of the MPD (Multi-Purpose Detector) at the accelerator facility Nuclotron-NICA. Collisions of relativistic heavy-ions at energies in the range of 4 to 11 GeV per nucleon in the center-of-mass system which are planned at the NICA collider allows for experimental investigation of the QGM in the region of high net-baryon densities exceeding that of the normal nuclear matter by 5-10 times.

Among the main experimentally observable effects which is sensitive to the properties of the QGM in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is the azimuthal collective flow of the produced hadrons relative to the collision symmetry plane. Detailed investigation of the azimuthal anisotropies at energies of the RHIC and LHC colliders and comparison with the model calculations demonstrated strong sensitivity of the azimuthal anisotropies to the QGM properties such as its equation of state, magnitude of the shear and bulk viscosity, ans well as to the mechanism of the hadronization.

The goal of this project is to develop and deploy experimental measurement techniques for the azimuthal collective flow measurement with the MPD experiment at the NICA collider for different types of hadrons produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions. As a result of the project implementation a numerical modelling of the anisotropic collective flow based on the modern Monte-Carlo event generators of heavy-ion collisions with subsequent simulation of the realistic response of the MPD detector subsystems based on the GEANT platform and reconstruction algorithms build in the MPDROOT will be performed. A set of simulated heavy-ions collisions will be used for deploying of the existing and development of new algorithms for the measurement of the anisotropic collective flow which will utilize different combinations of the MPD detector subsystems.
